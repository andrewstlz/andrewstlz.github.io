    <b>Week 2 (Ulises CarrioÃÅn - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts)</b>
    <br><br>
    This was quite the philosophical reading. I enjoyed learning about the different interpretations of "mail art", how mail and art function and contribute to the art form, and how it has evolved over time. It was interesting to learn about EAMIS and how it challenges the traditional post office authority to create a new mechanism for communication of art. I also found the concept of a Big Monster very intriguing, especially when considering the amount of agency that we have over our artistic production and how we can challenge the constraints placed upon by bureaucracy to defend creative expression. When I took DSGN 0110, I made an animation project that aimed to challenge the cycle of punishment as established by the justice system, so I really resonated with the notion of breaking out of and challenging existing structures. 
    <br><br>
    1. Is there an objective way to view or comment on a piece of mail art?
    <br><br>
    2. How does the Big Monster affect our interpretation or constrain our expression of a piece of art?

    <b>Week 3 (Laurel Schwulst & EÃÅdouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully)</b>
    <br><br>
    In the first reading, Laurel Schwulst discusses how the Internet has become a place where we live, and why individuals should start their own websites in order to counteract the corporate influences imposed by big tech and social media companies. I find the metaphor of a garden to be the most appealing, as it is really difficult to tend to the website and add new ideas all year round. There might be periods of stagnation and other periods of vibrant input. I'm also intrigued by the idea of embracing imperfection on websites, which adds an individual flair to it. The other article by EÃÅdouard U elucidates captivating ideas to promote mindful and creative use of the Internet. I respect his attempts in avoiding linear construction and using unorthodox ways to explore and experiment with the Internet to create new meaning. The gardening techniques that he proposes make a lot of sense and I would love to give "artificial learning" a try in order to understand if it really works. 
    <br><br>
    1. How should the notion of a website being "dead" inform our decisions in creating a website that can create value?
    <br><br>
    2. What are the consequences with being "led along" on a linear path while consuming information?

    <b>Week 4 (Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives.pdf)</b>
    <br><br>
    I found this reading to be intellectually stimulating. I didn't know a lot about Geocities and the amateur web before, and I really enjoyed learning about all of the content, from the types of personal websites and "neighborhoods" at the start of the web, to the death and legacy of Geocities on current websites. I can also see a link between this reading and the previous one by Ulises Carrion about the big monster - the extent by which Geocities controls how much freedom users can have, and that once the platform was shut down, a lot of information gets instantly lost. I really like how we can still have the knowledge of these old website pages thanks to people who rescued them. It essentially is a form of human history, tech history that records the culture of the people living at the time. It was also interesting to learn about c.gif, as I never thought about needing to insert empty space on a website and always take it for granted as a built-in functionality. What I felt most connected to was the part about Under Construction pages - pages that were never actually realized. I feel like there's a lot in life that I want to achieve, perhaps tell myself that I'm going to do it someday, but end up forgetting about it entirely.  
    <br><br>
    1. Does the value of a website depend more on the content, the design, or the state of being there?
    <br><br>
    2. How can a website hosting platform balance the interests of investors and users to optimize the browsing and creating experience? Or perhaps, how would this extend to other company-customer relations?

    <b>Week 5 (David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design)</b>
    <br><br>
    The selections from "A *New* Program for Graphic Design" offered me a renewed understanding of design, visual perception, and how this all comes to play in the age of web technology.

In the first part of the reading, I found the Dot Essay example to be particularly interesting, where the author describes how we group dots as orienting in a certain direction explained by Gestalt principles. When the author introduced the zoetrope and tachistoscope, I was intrigued at the idea that we could determine an exact speed where we start to treat the illusory movement as reality, and whether that hints at anything about how our mind's visual processing works. The example about the waterfall effect also reminded me of a visual neuroscience I took last semester, where we learnt about the opponency effect and how that contributes to a reverse image when we view image moving in a certain direction for a long period of time. 

In the next extract, the author starts talking about the book "A Primer of Visual Literacy". I think the example of the watch also prompts us the question of whether what we are seeing is real or is just a construction of reality. I also learnt something about the use of quartz in digital watches - super cool! 

In the final part, the author introduced several prominent figures in the early web era - Susan Kare, George Corrin, Paul Rand and Stewart Brand. I found Corrin's story to be the most fascinating, especially how he managed to create the split screen effect so nicely at a time when there weren't any editing software or professional cameras to help him with that. I was a little confused with Stewart Brand's story maybe partially because of the run-on sentences, though I think it was interesting to consider how some of his seemingly absurd design projects were speculated to have led way to important scientific progress such as the first full-color photographs of Earth released by NASA, or even the development of WWW. I love the quote "We can't put it together. It is together", an (anti-)climatic end of the reading, which leaves me in philosophical contemplation regarding how we know what we know, where we are, and how everything or anything is real at all. 
    <br><br>
    1. After examining the tachistoscope experiment example, the author suggests that apparent movement and real movement are perceptually equivalent - that is, it is not an illusion. However, what do we define as an illusion? How do we classify something as an illusion versus a real perception?
    <br><br>
    2. To what extent do we perceive the world in organized wholes that is not a sum of its parts? What do we define as a part then, if everything is a whole of itself?

    <b>Week 6 (Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print)</b>
    <br><br>
    The conclusion "Post-digital print: a future scenario" by the book author Alessandro Ludovico illustrates how the paradigm change in the world of print and publishing is sluggish, with valid reasons. I reflected on the merits and limitations of print media and how digital media may not be able to replace the tactile qualities of a physical book or publication, yet digitalization of print can extend the network of readers and ease the access of information. I really like the exploration of hybrid forms of print and digital media, and I think it would be amazing if we blur the boundaries between these two forms. However, I see no harm if some authors still choose to stick with print or go fully into digital, and I believe that creativity should not be limited by an obligation to be inclusive or to blend all forms of media. 

The afterword by Florian Cramer highlighted the advantages that print media still hold over its digital counterparts, because of the networks that exist in book communities. I found the discussion of conceptual art and sculptural art to be quite intriguing, because I never thought about quantifying the amount of "material" that would be appropriate for a book. 
    <br><br>
    1. How does the times in which we are living in enhance or limit our understanding of the development of the post-digital era?
    <br><br>
    2. What is the purpose of creating intentional hybrid art forms and what value does it hold for the print and publishing community?

    <b>Week 8 (Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook)</b>
    <br><br>
    Alt text - oh, where should I begin! I've always been kind of annoyed by alt text. Well, not exactly, but alt text only appears when my webpage is running at tortoise speed and it acts as a placeholder until my image loads, so I guess by association I don't have a particular positive opinion of alt text either. Yet this reading surprised me with how it laid out the different uses and intricacies that alt text could embody. I started thinking about what in fact is useful to include in alt text - what blind or visually impaired people care about learning about an image? If they haven't seen images before in their lives and the image on a website is just a side illustration, what is the point of describing it to them? I came to the conclusion that maybe the ideal alt text is more about describing the purpose of the image more than the visual details.  
    <br><br>
    1. To what extent are artists themselves suitable to create alt text for their images?
    <br><br>
    2. If objectivity is an elusive and unattainable concept when applied to descriptions, how should a piece of image description provide the best and most informative experience for its audience?

    <b>Week 10 (Ben Duvall - Selections from New Modernism(s))</b>
    <br><br>
    This reading touched upon several big concepts in modernist, post-modernist and hyper-modernist designs. Duvall characterized modernist design as using a set structure, post-modernist design as challenging structure, and hyper-modernist design as having this illusory property that challenges the construction of semiotics as the signifiers themselves often contain the meaning. I found it quite interesting that the author criticized Disney's use of iconography, but I don't quite understand what the author meant by Disney being a "survivor of postmodernism" and that we need to be "suspicious of the signified". 
    <br><br>
    1. How does hyper-modernism affect creative expression?
    <br><br>
    2. To what extent does the surface of a design contribute meaning to an art, and vice versa?

    <b>Week 12 (Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel‚Äôs String Games)</b>
    <br><br>
    This article by Dot Tuer made me reflect on how structure and lack of 
structure can influence the interpretation of an artwork. In Vera Frenkel's "String Games", there is an inherent structure and order by which the string can be passed on and weaved into patterns, yet there is also something special about how each person participating in the construction contributes to the formation. It is also interesting to learn about the history and development of prototype technologies, and how historical marginalization impeded her art from getting publicized. I wasn't really sure what the poetics of absence meant, but I am assuming that it has something to do with the lack of meaning. 
    <br><br>
    1. How can art best portray abstract concepts like communication and loss?
    <br><br>
    2. What motivated Frenkel to create experimental art forms?

    <b>Week 13 (Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed)</b>
    <br><br>
    I really enjoyed this reading (presentation) by Paul Soulellis. Paul set the stage with an exploration of what a "post" means in the pre- and post-internet eras, as well as how a new form of media, the "feed", has been generated to fulfill people's desire for connecting from different locations at the same time, and to satisfy a never-ending boredom via instant and unpredictable surprises. It also explored some potential issues that might arise from this new art form, such as leaks and untrustworthy information. 
    <br><br>
    1. To what extent can smooth flow replace the conventional paradigm of posting?
    <br><br>
    2. What are the implications of a rise in limitless feed media for social connections at large?

    <b>Week 14 (Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons)</b>
    <br><br>
    I really enjoyed reading this storybook about computers and technology. The story follows a kid named Gem who is really good at computers but neglects everything else in life, especially connections with other people. Gem was then physically sucked into the computer and has interactions with The Way and The Beyond, which represent the current state of technology and its master-slave relationships in executing control, versus the prioritization of using computation to build community and connection. I occasionally feel this disconnect between computer science classes and the real world, as well as the ethical impacts of these algorithms, which is insinuated throughout this story.
    <br><br>
    1. What would human-computer interactions be like if we no longer exert "control" on designing computer systems?
    <br><br>
    2. How can design provide a solution to connect computer science with real-world impacts?

    <b>Week 15 (Boris Groys - Art on the Internet)</b>
    <br><br>
    I really enjoyed this reading as it explored several fundamental concepts that underly the shift from physical, concrete art production, to art production on the web. In particular, I enjoyed learning and reflecting about the discussion of globalization and encryption, as well as the trajectory of an author. As a creator, I often feel so disconnected from my audience as I start by releasing a video into a global audience and often having to draw the attention of local audiences like my family and friends afterwards, whereas traditional art production scales from the local to the global, by word of mouth and other connections. It was also interesting to learn about the concept of someone watching over you because you are producing and displaying art on the web at the same time, essentially destroying the creative space that was existent in physical production of art where the artist could exclude themselves from the outside world to engage in self-contemplative thought and creative discovery. 
    <br><br>
    1. How does the monetization of classical hermeneutics by Internet corporations impact the ways in which web art should be created?
    <br><br>
    2. To what extent is the state of temporary absence lost in web design? that is, do we really feel like we are gazed at and influenced when writing an essay on a laptop, as opposed to writing it on a piece of paper?
